## About Me  

Hello! Welcome, and thanks for stopping by.

I'm a PhD candidate at Duke University studying how our motivational states direct our information seeking decisions. I joined Duke through the [Cognitive Neuroscience Admitting Program (CNAP)](https://dibs.duke.edu/education/graduate/cnap) in 2017.

Before coming to Duke, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2015, where I worked with [Dr. Tracy Riggins](http://ncdl.umd.edu/index.html) examining the development of episodic memory in children. I, then, spent two years working at the National Institutes of Mental Health with [Drs. Christian Grillon and Monique Ernst](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/snfa) studying the impact of anxiety of learning and memory.

## Research
I am co-mentored by [Drs. Alison Adcock](https://www.adcocklab.org/) and [Scott Huettel](https://sites.duke.edu/huettellab/). My research investigates how our **motivational states** direct our **information seeking decisions**.

- Motivational states refer to internal states that propel our behavior towards particular goals. These goals could be to obtain rewards, to regulate or alter our emotions, or simply to comprehend the world around us.
- Information seeking decisions refers to how we search for, collect, and integrate information from our external world. This includes, where we search for information, what we choose to look at, and how we decide to stop seeking information.

I am particularly interested in the motivational state of **curiosity** and how information search occurs over multiple **sequential choices**. My primary research questions are:

1. What strategies do we use to help us determine how much information to gather before making a decision? _(E.g., How do you decide how many reviews you need to read before purchasing a product from a website)_
2. Does the motivational state of curiosity shape our preferences for how we receive information? _(E.g., If you're curious about a new movie do you read spoilers or wait to see it first?)_
3. What does it feel like to be curious? Does the affective experience of curiosity shape how curiosity, then, directs information seeking?
