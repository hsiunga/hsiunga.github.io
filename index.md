## About Me  

Hello! Welcome, and thanks for stopping by.

I'm a PhD candidate at Duke University studying how our motivational states direct our information seeking decisions. I joined Duke through the [Cognitive Neuroscience Admitting Program (CNAP)](https://dibs.duke.edu/education/graduate/cnap) in 2017.

Before coming to Duke, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2015, where I worked with [Dr. Tracy Riggins](http://ncdl.umd.edu/index.html) examining the development of episodic memory in children. I then spent two years working at the National Institutes of Mental Health with [Drs. Christian Grillon and Monique Ernst](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/snfa) studying the impact of anxiety of learning and memory.

## Research
I am co-mentored by [Drs. Alison Adcock](https://www.adcocklab.org/) and [Scott Huettel](https://sites.duke.edu/huettellab/). My research investigates how our **motivational states** direct our **information seeking decisions**.

- Motivational states refer to internal states that propel our behavior towards particular goals. These goals could be to obtain rewards, to regulate or alter our emotions, or simply to comprehend the world around us.
- Information seeking decisions refers to how we search for, collect, and integrate information from our external world. This includes, where we search for information, what we choose to look at, and how we decide to stop seeking information.

I am particularly interested in the motivational state of **curiosity** and how information search occurs over multiple **sequential choices**. My primary research questions are:

1. What strategies do we use to help us determine how much information to gather before making a decision?
2. Does the motivational state of curiosity shape our preferences for how we receive information?
3. What does it feel like to be curious? Does the affective experience of curiosity shape how curiosity, then, directs information seeking?

### Information Seeking Strategies 
_How do you decide how many reviews you need to read before purchasing a product from a website?_

In a world full of uncertainty, seeking information can help us improve our predictions of how likely different events or outcomes will occur. But, information seeking can be costly, it takes time, energy, and resources to collect, integrate, and use that information to guide our choices. One critical question is what strategies do we use to decide how much information is enough?

To investigate our question, we asked people to sample pictures of indoor or outdoor scenes from a box before deciding whether they thought the box contained more indoor or outdoor scenes. Each sampled picture, however, came with a small monetary cost to look at. We were interested in how people balanced the benefit of sampling pictures and improving predictions against these accruing costs.

In order to capture information seeking choices, we developed a series of computational models to test what information people were using in their decision process and how they were using it.

### Curiosity and Information Seeking
_If you're curious about a new movie do you read spoilers or wait to see it first?_

_If curiosity makes you anxious, do you seek information differently than if curiosity makes you excited?_

Curiosity, the motivational state that compels us to seek information, is a fundamental part of human cognition. But how exactly does curiosity guide our information seeking?

To investigate our question, we developed a novel way to examine information seeking: dynamic art videos. In our task, people saw videos of single-line drawings evolving over time (see visualization below). While they watched, we periodically asked them questions, for example to guess what they thought the drawing's identity was or how curious they were to see the final drawing. We then gave people the choice to continue watching the video or move to the next video.

Using this design, we've examined a variety of questions into how people prefer to experience these videos, how it feels to be curious, and what kinds of information and search experiences contribute to the growth and sustainment of curiosity.

## Teaching, Mentoring, & DEI Efforts
In the Fall of 2020, I co-founded a program to promote equitable access to cognitive research at Duke University. Our program, the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Internship (CNRI), is a collaborative program specializing in providing foundational skills in experimental design and Python programming to STEM students from underrepresented groups.

- [Visit our GitHub page for Python tutorials & resources](https://github.com/Duke-CNRI)

In the Spring of 2021, I joined the leadership team at Scientists Promoting Equity and Knowledge (SPEAK), an organization at Duke dedicated to providing a space to engage with and tackle issues of equity and power in academia. The mission of SPEAK is to promote a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for early-career scientists.
